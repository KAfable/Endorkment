# Notes

## Interview w/Kelsey on 4/8/2020

### Pros

- really liked background in finance, tinkering with things
- never felt more fufilled than in the past nine months, confirms that I belong in this industry
- video games: avoid making it seem like, it's a very common story and everyone's eyes glaze over it
  - come at it with a really unique angle
  - could put myself into a box with this story
    - if interviewer is a gamer: same old story,
    - if non-gamer:
  - emphasize the part about having 370k downloads, started making income

### Cons

- don't bring up anything negative that isn't anything asked for
- wrap up my responses a bit more quickly
  - best way to do that is to collect all of your responses and cherry pick from them
- try to ask more questions, use this platform to collect your stories/thoughts
