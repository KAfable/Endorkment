### Questions

Why use Redux?

- when it's more complex you need to manage the state
- really focus on the complexity

Talking About API Calls

- difference between GET/POST

When do we need to use a POST?

- never through GET (searching for something in a webpage)
- GET has a limit on the amount of data that you can send
- POST has no limits on the data

HTTPS

- guarantees the certificate is created

JWT

- subject
- expiry date (make sure you are still there after 5 minutes of being logged in)

SQL

- backend
- LEFTJOIN
- RIGHTJOIN what is common
- need more practice regarding SQL

General

- always answer high level first, don't go into implementation details
- easy to talk myself into a corner
- easy to go off the wrong way
